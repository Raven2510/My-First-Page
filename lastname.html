        Night Sky

    <p>
        After a long busy day of working with my school works, being exhausted and stressed about consecutive classes.
        I always find myself craving for something... It's not about food, but by going out for a while, taking some fresh air, and meditating to relax my head.
        Whenever I looked at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>night sky</strong></a>, I was always captivated by its <strong>beauty</strong>, that I couldn't take my eyes off of it. The depth of <strong>darkness</strong> surrounded my eyes, the glowing <strong>moon</strong>, and the <strong>stars</strong> above.
        I always wonder how vast the <strong>space</strong> that contains billions of <strong>heavenly bodies</strong> is. That made me realize that my <strong>mind</strong> could never <strong>visualize</strong>
        the greatness of <strong>God</strong> through his <strong>creations</strong>.
